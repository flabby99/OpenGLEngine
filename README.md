I will describe the layout of the code and some future ideas here later
I will attempt to update the code base to follow https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html and continue to follow it

#Things to do
I need to support loading textures - will use stb for image loading
To make loading faster, keep track of which textures have been loaded -- see https://learnopengl.com/Model-Loading/Model
